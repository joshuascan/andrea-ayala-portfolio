          I worked at All American Label & Packaging from 2016-2021 as a
          Pre-Press Production Artist. I preflight, proofed, and prepared print
          ready art files, specializing in labels for wine, food, cosmetics and
          cannabis products. Here is just a sample of a few labels I&apos;ve
          worked to produce.
