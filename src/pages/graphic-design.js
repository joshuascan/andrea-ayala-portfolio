          Editorial design projects which involved exploring different
          typefaces, their histories and classifications through reading and
          research. Each student chose two different typefaces to examine and
          create an editorial style spread. The purpose of the assignment was to
          gain experience using type and elements of design to enhance meaning
          and to develop an appreciation of type as letter forms in composition.
